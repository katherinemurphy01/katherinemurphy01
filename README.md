- 👋 Hi, I’m @katherinemurphy01
- 👀 I’m interested in absolutely everything, I can't decide on anything particular at the moment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and SQL
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment. I'm currently collaborating with my fellow infrastructure TAs for the Software Design and 
Implementation Course at UW to make the existing infrastructure more modular and well-documented! :)
